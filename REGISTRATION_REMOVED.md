# ✅ Changes Completed - Registration Removed

## What Was Changed:

### 1. ✅ Removed Registration Route
- Removed `/register` route from `src/App.tsx`
- Removed `RegisterPage` import

### 2. ✅ Removed Registration Link
- Removed "Don't have an account? Create one now" link from Login page
- Registration page is no longer accessible

### 3. ✅ Added Role Selection to Login
- Added Role dropdown field to login form
- Required fields: Username, Password, and Role
- Options: Technician, Supervisor, Planning Engineer

### 4. ✅ Database-Only Authentication
- Removed hardcoded password check (`password !== 'password'`)
- Login now **only** authenticates against database
- Users must exist in database to login
- Backend validates credentials with `password_verify()`

### 5. ✅ Updated Help Text
- Changed from "Demo Credentials" to "Available Users (from database)"
- Shows actual database usernames:
  - Engineer: `admin`
  - Supervisor: `supervisor1`
  - Technician: `tech001`, `tech002`, etc.

## How Login Works Now:

1. **User enters:**
   - Username (must exist in database)
   - Password (must match database password)
   - Role (must match database role)

2. **Backend validates:**
   - Checks if username exists in database
   - Checks if role matches database role
   - Verifies password using `password_verify()`

3. **Success:**
   - Creates PHP session
   - Returns user data
   - Frontend logs user in

4. **Failure:**
   - Shows "Invalid credentials" error
   - User cannot login

## ✅ Security Features:

- ✅ **No registration** - Only database users can login
- ✅ **Password hashing** - Passwords stored securely (bcrypt)
- ✅ **Role verification** - Must match database role
- ✅ **Session management** - PHP sessions for authentication

## 🧪 Test Login:

Use these database users (password: `password`):

- **Engineer/Admin:**
  - Username: `admin`
  - Role: `engineer`

- **Supervisor:**
  - Username: `supervisor1`
  - Role: `supervisor`

- **Technician:**
  - Username: `tech001` (or tech002-tech016)
  - Role: `technician`

## 📝 Notes:

- Registration functionality is completely removed
- `/register` route returns 404
- Only users in database can login
- Mock data is disabled (USE_MOCK=false by default)

---

**All done!** Users can now only login with database credentials. 🎉
