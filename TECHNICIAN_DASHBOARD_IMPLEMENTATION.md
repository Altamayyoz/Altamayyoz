# Technician Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
A complete production technician dashboard that connects technicians with supervisors for work log approval, fully integrated with the database.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Dashboard Interface**
- **Summary Cards**: Display efficiency, productivity, utilization, and tasks completed
- **Three Main Tabs**:
  - Assigned Tasks: View and work on assigned tasks
  - My Work Logs: View submitted work logs and their approval status
  - Performance: Personal performance metrics and statistics

### 2. **Task Logging**
- Start Task button for each assigned task
- Complete log submission form with:
  - Date selection
  - Device serial number entry (add multiple serials)
  - Actual time spent (minutes)
  - Notes field for delays/issues
  - Automatic efficiency calculation
- Submit logs to supervisor for approval

### 3. **Work Log Management**
- View all submitted work logs
- See approval status (Pending/Approved/Rejected)
- Display serial numbers, time data, and efficiency metrics
- View notes and comments

### 4. **Performance Tracking**
- Personal efficiency percentage
- Productivity metrics
- Utilization rate
- Total tasks completed
- Total hours worked

### 5. **Database Integration**
- Created `/api/technician_tasks.php` backend API
- Handles GET requests for fetching assigned tasks and daily logs
- Handles POST requests for submitting new work logs
- Connects to supervisor approval workflow
- Automatically calculates efficiency metrics

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `src/pages/technician/TechnicianDashboard.tsx` - Main technician dashboard component
2. `backend/api/technician_tasks.php` - API endpoint for technician operations
3. `TECHNICIAN_DASHBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation file

### Modified Files:
1. `src/App.tsx` - Added technician route and role-based routing
2. `src/types/index.ts` - Added 'Technician' to Role type

## Database Tables Used

1. **tasks** - Stores task entries and work logs
2. **technicians** - Links users to technician profiles
3. **device_serial_numbers** - Tracks device serials per task
4. **job_orders** - Contains job order information
5. **approvals** - Tracks supervisor approvals
6. **performance_metrics** - Stores calculated performance data

## Workflow

### Technician Workflow:
1. Login as technician
2. View assigned tasks on dashboard
3. Click "Start Task" on a pending task
4. Enter work details:
   - Add device serial numbers
   - Enter actual time spent
   - Add notes if needed
5. Submit for supervisor approval
6. View approval status in "My Work Logs" tab
7. Monitor performance metrics

### Supervisor Integration:
- Technicians submit work logs with status "pending"
- Supervisors see pending work logs in their dashboard
- Supervisors approve/reject with comments
- Approved logs update performance metrics
- Rejected logs return to technician for correction

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/technician_tasks.php`
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Tasks retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "assigned_tasks": [...],
    "daily_logs": [...]
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/technician_tasks.php`
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "123",
  "job_order_id": "JO-001",
  "operation_name": "Quality Assemblage I",
  "devices_completed": 5,
  "serial_numbers": ["SN001", "SN002", ...],
  "actual_time_minutes": 20,
  "standard_time_minutes": 18,
  "efficiency_percentage": 90,
  "notes": "Minor delay due to material shortage",
  "date": "2025-01-15",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

## Authentication
- Session-based authentication using PHP sessions
- Technician ID: 25 (tech_user)
- Role: 'technician'
- Credentials: username='tech_user', password='password'

## Testing

### How to Test:
1. Login as tech_user (password: password)
2. Navigate to technician dashboard
3. View assigned tasks
4. Click "Start Task" on any task
5. Fill in the form:
   - Add at least one serial number
   - Enter actual time (optional, defaults to standard time)
   - Add notes (optional)
6. Click "Submit for Approval"
7. Check "My Work Logs" tab to see the submitted log
8. Login as supervisor to approve/reject the work log
9. Check "Performance" tab to see updated metrics

## Key Features

✅ **All buttons are interactive**
✅ **Connected to database**
✅ **Integrated with supervisor approval workflow**
✅ **Automatic efficiency calculation**
✅ **Real-time data loading**
✅ **Toast notifications for user feedback**
✅ **Proper error handling**
✅ **Responsive design**
✅ **Dark mode support**

## Next Steps

To fully test the system:
1. Assign tasks to technician from supervisor/admin panel
2. Submit work logs from technician dashboard
3. Approve/reject logs from supervisor dashboard
4. Verify metrics update correctly
5. Test the approval history feature

## Notes

- The system uses session-based authentication
- All technician actions are logged in the activity_log table
- Efficiency is calculated as: (standard_time / actual_time) * 100
- Work logs with status 'pending' appear in supervisor approval queue
- Performance metrics update automatically when work logs are approved
