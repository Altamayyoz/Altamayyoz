# Approval History Implementation - Complete ✅

## Summary
Created a comprehensive approval history table and interactive system for tracking all approved/rejected actions. This will be used by engineers to review past approvals.

## What Was Created

### 1. **Database Table: `approval_history`** ✅
```sql
CREATE TABLE approval_history (
  approval_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id INT NOT NULL,
  supervisor_id INT NOT NULL,
  technician_id INT NULL,
  action_type ENUM('approved', 'rejected') NOT NULL,
  comments TEXT,
  approval_date TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (task_id) REFERENCES tasks(task_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (supervisor_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (technician_id) REFERENCES technicians(technician_id)
)
```

### 2. **Backend API: `approval_history.php`** ✅
- GET endpoint to fetch approval history
- Filter by action type (approved/rejected)
- Filter by technician
- Filter by date range
- Pagination support
- Accessible to engineers and supervisors

### 3. **Enhanced `approvals.php`** ✅
- Automatically saves to approval_history when approve/reject
- Stores full details including comments and technician info

### 4. **Frontend Integration** ✅
- Added ApprovalHistory interface
- Added state management for history
- Integrated with loadDashboardData()
- Ready for UI display

## How It Works

### When Approve/Reject is Used:
1. Supervisor clicks approve/reject
2. Adds comment (optional for approve, required for reject)
3. System updates `tasks` table
4. **NEW:** System inserts into `approval_history` table with:
   - Task details
   - Technician info
   - Supervisor info
   - Action type (approved/rejected)
   - Comments
   - Timestamp

### For Engineers to Use:
```javascript
// Fetch all approvals
GET /api/approval_history.php

// Filter by action
GET /api/approval_history.php?action=approved
GET /api/approval_history.php?action=rejected

// Filter by technician
GET /api/approval_history.php?technician_id=5

// Filter by date range
GET /api/approval_history.php?date_from=2025-10-01&date_to=2025-10-31

// Pagination
GET /api/approval_history.php?limit=10&offset=0
```

## Database Structure

### Fields in `approval_history`:
- **approval_id** - Unique identifier
- **task_id** - Links to tasks table
- **supervisor_id** - Who made the approval/rejection
- **technician_id** - Who performed the work
- **action_type** - 'approved' or 'rejected'
- **comments** - Supervisor's comments
- **approval_date** - When action was taken
- **operation_name** - Task operation name (joined from tasks)
- **efficiency_percentage** - Work efficiency (joined from tasks)
- **supervisor_name** - Name of supervisor (joined from users)
- **technician_name** - Name of technician (joined from users)

## API Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Approval history retrieved successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "approval_id": 50,
      "task_id": 2,
      "supervisor_id": 24,
      "technician_id": 5,
      "action_type": "approved",
      "comments": "Great work!",
      "approval_date": "2025-10-30 02:45:00",
      "operation_name": "Quality Test",
      "devices_completed": 3,
      "efficiency_percentage": 40.00,
      "supervisor_name": "Test Supervisor",
      "technician_name": "Bob Smith",
      "job_order_id": "JO-001"
    }
  ],
  "total": 50,
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 0
}
```

(task_id, supervisor_id, technician_id, action_type, comments) 
VALUES (2, 24, 5, 'approved', 'Test approval - system working');
```

### Test API:
```
http://localhost/api/approval_history.php?limit=10&action=approved
```

## Status

✅ Database table created and working
✅ Backend API implemented and tested
✅ Frontend integration complete
✅ Ready for engineers to use
✅ Interactive filtering available

## Next Steps (Optional UI)

To add a UI tab in supervisor dashboard:
1. Add "Approval History" tab
2. Display history with filters
3. Show approve/reject status
4. Display comments
5. Add export functionality

The backend is ready - just add the UI frontend!
